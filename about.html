          Heyyyy I am a Software Engineer with a passion for building applications that make a positive impact on people's lives. 
          My fascination for computers and the IT world started from a young age however due to circumstances beyond my control, I was only 
          able to explore this further as an adult. I also have a passion for the environment and studied towards a Geophysics 
          degree with the hopes of being a Marine Geophysicist, however getting a job in this field is difficult and therefore I 
          decided to explore my other passion which is IT. <br><br>
  
          My Software Development journey started when I attended a one week boot camp which was organized by a group known as Young Professional Forum (YPF). 
          Though I didn't have a laptop at the time, I wrote all the notes I could, which I still reference now and again. The training I received 
          really captured me and to further enhance my skills, I applied for the HNG Internship. There, I learnt more in-depth 
          programming techniques and was exposed to real life projects. After the internship stage, I was made aware of the 
          Google Africa Developer Scholarship and I knew I needed to learn more and wanted to level up my skill sets. 
          I applied and successfully made it through all phases for the Mobile Web Specialist track. <br><br>
          After my Google Africa Scholarship journey I applied for the African App Launchpad Scholarship and was 
          awarded to complete a fully paid for Web Design course.
  
          The various initiatives mentioned above has assisted me in leveling up my Software development skills for the working world. 
  
          Skilled in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Angular, Bootstrap and more.
